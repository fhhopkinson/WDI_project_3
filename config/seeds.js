Crops from the garden will be shared with local people and food banks. Projects like honey and hops will be shared with volunteers and supporters.

This paper explains the lobbying success of these industries in terms of the strategic role of investment as a credible commitment device. It is demonstrated that if governments are predisposed to special interest groups, underinvestment in new technology enables firms to lobby more effectively. Such industries are shown to be better placed to extract policy concessions, despite contributing less to the government in political donations. The analysis therefore suggests that political considerations may provide a significant incentive for firms to reject environmentally beneficial investments, even when these lower production costs.",

The fences were too low and were not anchored in the ground, allowing the badgers to climb over or crawl under them and onto the road. The fences also frequently developed large holes, so they offered little protection. These deficiencies were corrected in later projects. Near the town of Heumen, for example, the national Ministry of Transport constructed five tunnels under the highway and built higher, stronger fences. Escape gates were put in the fences at one-kilometer-intervals to protect any badgers that ended up on the road. These meant the badgers could get off the roads, but couldn't get back on again.",
